# Day 8

Antennas are tuned to a specific frequecy

Frequencies are indicated by a single `lowercase letter`, `uppercase letter`, or `digit`.
The bad signal only occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency.

> [!CHECK] But only when one of the antennas is **twice** as far away as the other.

meaning any pair of antenna with the same frequency (twice as far from each other) there are **two** antinodes
, one on either side of the pair
