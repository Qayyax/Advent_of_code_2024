# Day 8

Antennas are tuned to a specific frequecy

Frequencies are indicated by a single `lowercase letter`, `uppercase letter`, or `digit`.
The bad signal only occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency.

> [!CHECK] But only when one of the antennas is **twice** as far away as the other.

meaning any pair of antenna with the same frequency (twice as far from each other) there are **two** antinodes
, one on either side of the pair

> [!INFO] row and col

- Frequencies (lowercase, uppercase or digit)
- pairs of the same frequency on different rows and col
  - there is a row gap between the frequency pair
  - There is also 1 row gap between the antinodes
- Antinode can appear on a frequency as well

I think the antinodes distance are of equal size to the row distance

> [!TIP] check all directions as well

because diagonally there can be a row gap as well
but if the antinodes are out of bonds, at least one out of bound **ignore**
